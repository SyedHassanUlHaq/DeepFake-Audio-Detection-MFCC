Extracting MFCC Features:
The extract_mfcc_features function is responsible for loading an audio file and extracting its MFCC features. It uses the librosa library to load the audio file and calculate the MFCCs. The MFCCs are then averaged across time frames to obtain a fixed-length feature vector.

Loading the SVM Model and Scaler:
The trained SVM model and the scaler used for feature scaling during training are loaded from the pickle files (svm_model.pkl and scaler.pkl) using the joblib.load function.

Analyzing the Input Audio:
The analyze_audio function takes the path of an audio file as input. It calls the extract_mfcc_features function to extract the MFCC features from the audio. If the audio file does not exist or is not in the .wav format, it returns an appropriate error message.

Scaling the MFCC Features:
The extracted MFCC features are scaled using the previously trained scaler loaded from scaler.pkl. Scaling is essential to ensure that the features are in the same range as they were during training.

Making Predictions:
The scaled MFCC features are then passed to the SVM classifier loaded from svm_model.pkl to make a prediction. The SVM model classifies the audio into either genuine (class 0) or deepfake (class 1).

Displaying the Result:
The Flask web application allows users to upload an audio file on the web interface. The uploaded file is saved temporarily in the "uploads" folder, and the analyze_audio function is called to analyze the audio. The result, which is either "The input audio is classified as genuine." or "The input audio is classified as deepfake.", is then displayed on the web page.
